# Sudoku Solver
## C version
Build the program using the makefile by executing the `make` command.

To run the program use the command `./SudokuSolver [input_file]`

Input files should take the format of a 9x9 grid if integers with 0s representing empty spaces.
There are some sample input files provided and their solutions.

The program can also be used to test if a solution is valid by just feeding the program your solution as an input

## Python version
Same thing except `python3 SudokuSolver.py [input_file]`
